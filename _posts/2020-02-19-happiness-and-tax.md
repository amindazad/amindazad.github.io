Since the great depression democrats and republicans have disagreed on tax policy in almost every election and as we approach the 2020 presidential election candidates in both state and federal level have proposed over 300 tax policy proposals on both sides of political spectrum. Tax plans say a lot about candidates’ policy goals, how they view the role of government and how they plan to accomplish their goals. But, what’s the purpose of taxation and why it’s important that everyone pays their fair share ?
U.S. Department of Treasury describes the main purpose of taxes is to be used for public investment, the production of public goods and to improve social welfare by redistributing income in the entire population. To simplify it, we pay taxes so the government could have enough resources to ensure our safety and well being.
Two main political parties in the United States have a different interpretation of taxation and its effectiveness to deliver safety and wellbeing to the society.The democrats argue for effectiveness of taxation in enabling the federal government to improve social safety nets and it turn increase life standards all across the board by raising tax rates, and the republicans side with trickle down economics in which small government would improve society’s well being by cutting taxes and regulations, and in turn providing more wealth and economic freedom to the masses.
In the following few paragraphs we are going to take a closer look at the economic data of democratic market driven economies (OECD) all over the globe and try to evaluate which school of thought has delivered better results for the masses in 2018. We are going to cover 2018 data since 2019 economic datasets for some of OECD countries has not been published yet.


## Taxes Rates and Life Expectancy

Life expectancy measures the average length of life for the whole society and it is often used to compare quality of healthcare system among nations. High life expectancy could be a good proof for an effective high quality healthcare system available to the majority of society.
All OECD countries but the United States use a single payer healthcare system in which healthcare is guaranteed for every citizen and is funded through public funds. Figure 1 demonstrates the positive linear relationship between tax rates and life expectancy among OECD countries and size of each bubble indicates size of each economy adjusted by population. Now, we must keep in mind that correlation doesn’t imply causation and to scientifically proof that higher taxes result in higher life expectancy we need to include more data but it’s safe to say that as tax rates rise , life expectancy tends to increase in democratic market driven countries.

Figure 2 could show us where each country stands when it comes to life expectancy’s relationship with tax rates. We can see citizens of countries with higher tax rates were able to purchase a few extra years with their tax money.

## Tax Rates and Income Inequality

In order to measure the impact of the tax policy on income inequality, it is important to understand how income inequality itself is measured. There are a variety of different ways to measure income inequality, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Each metric, however, tells essentially the same story about income equality in the United States; We have relatively high levels of income inequality, income inequality has gotten worse over time, and the tax policy can make a significant difference in income inequality.
The most comprehensive and widely used measure of income inequality is the Gini index. This index (also known as the Gini coefficient, Gini ratio, or Gini score) essentially measures the difference between actual income distribution and a perfectly equitable distribution in which everyone makes the same amount. A perfectly equitable distribution of income scores a 0 on the Gini index, whereas the most unequal distribution, in which a single person makes all the income, scores a 1.
Taking a closer look at figure 3, we can see the correlation line between Gini coefficient and average tax rates is almost flat meaning based on our data set income inequality and average tax rates are not correlated. It is interesting that we were not able to find a relationship between the two using out dataset as one of the main functions of tax policy is to redistribute income across the whole population. It might be possible though to find the positive or the negative relationship between income inequality and tax rates by expanding our dataset through increasing time period but that remains to be done at another time.

## Tax Rates and Happiness Index

While the definition of individual happiness varies person-to-person, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network has managed to put some parameters around the otherwise abstract term. In order to compile their annual World Happiness Report, the team studies factors like GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity and perception of corruption in order to rank each country’s overall happiness.

As we can see in figure 4 there is a positive correlation between happiness score and average tax rates. While it’s important to note the difference between correlation and causation, many of the world’s happiest countries among OECD have higher average income taxes than the United States.

In examining the income tax rates of some of the happiest countries in the world, 14 of the 17 countries that have been deemed happier than the United States have higher income tax rates. It would, however, be unfair to say that taxes are the only factor in a country’s happiness. Even if it’s not immediately apparent, taxes do play a role in each of the six ranking factors (GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity and perception of corruption).
